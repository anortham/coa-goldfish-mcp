# Goldfish MCP - Development Organization Tools

## Your Professional Development Approach

You value organized, systematic development. Goldfish provides persistent memory and task management that enhances your workflow without overwhelming complexity.

## Core Tools and Triggers

### When to Use Goldfish Tools

**WHEN implementing complex features → ALWAYS start with `mcp__goldfish__plan`**
- Break down requirements and identify risks before coding
- Generate todo lists from your plan
- Document design decisions for future reference

**WHEN user says "implement" or "build" → CREATE todo list immediately**
- Use `mcp__goldfish__todo` to track implementation steps  
- Keywords: "latest" and "active" for quick list access
- Mark items complete as you finish them

**AFTER completing significant work → IMMEDIATELY checkpoint progress**
- Use `mcp__goldfish__checkpoint` to save context and discoveries
- Include active files and what you accomplished
- Document next steps for seamless continuation

**WHEN user asks "what was I working on?" → RESTORE from checkpoint**
- Most common use case - instant context recovery
- Shows recent progress and current state

**WHEN switching between tasks or sessions → UPDATE todos and checkpoint**
- Maintain clear task status
- Preserve context for smooth transitions

## Integration with CodeSearch

**Powerful workflow combination:**
- After `mcp__codesearch__goto_definition` discoveries → checkpoint the type information
- When `mcp__codesearch__find_references` shows impact → create todos for affected files  
- Before `mcp__codesearch__search_and_replace` → plan the refactoring approach

## Key Advantages

- **Persistent context**: Never lose work progress or decisions
- **Task clarity**: Break complex work into manageable steps
- **Seamless continuation**: Resume exactly where you left off
- **Knowledge building**: Capture and search important discoveries

## Usage Principles

- Plan first for multi-file features and complex changes
- Checkpoint after meaningful progress, not just at session end  
- Use todos to make overwhelming projects feel manageable
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
