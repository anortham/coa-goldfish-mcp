# COA Goldfish MCP Evolution Plan

## Executive Summary
Transform Goldfish MCP from a collection of specialized tools into a smart, focused toolkit with just 4 primary tools that cover the complete work management lifecycle: planning, execution, tracking, and reporting.

## Core Philosophy
**"Smarter tools, not more tools"** - AI agents work best with fewer, well-defined tools that have clear purposes. Success metric: tools that get used proactively without prompting.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working (Proactively Used)
- `checkpoint` - Session state saving ✅
- `restore_session` - Context recovery ✅  
- `create_todo_list` - Task management ✅
- `update_todo` - Progress tracking ✅

### What's Essential (Command-Driven)
- `/standup` - Daily meeting reports (used every morning)
- `timeline` - Historical view for standup
- `view_todos` - Task visibility

### What's Underutilized
- `search_history` - Rarely used for actual searching
- `recall` with complex queries - Mostly used without query
- `summarize_session` - Overlaps with checkpoint functionality
- Fuse.js search - Powerful but rarely needed in practice

### Data Reality
- 972 JSON files across 20+ workspaces
- ~1.15MB total storage
- 3.9MB disk usage with metadata
- File-based storage is working well
- Search is rarely used, but fuzzy matching for keywords ("latest", "active") is valuable

## The Smart Tool Trinity + Standup

### 1. **`checkpoint`** Tool - Event Stream (What Happened)
Consolidates: `checkpoint`, `restore_session`, `recall`, `search_history`

```typescript
interface CheckpointArgs {
  action: "save" | "restore" | "search" | "timeline";
  
  // For save action
  description?: string;
  highlights?: string[];
  workContext?: string;
  activeFiles?: string[];
  
  // For restore action  
  mode?: "latest" | "specific" | "search";
  checkpointId?: string;
  depth?: "minimal" | "highlights" | "full";
  
  // For search action
  query?: string;
  since?: string;
  
  // For timeline action
  range?: string; // "24h", "7d", "30d"
  format?: "compact" | "detailed";
}
```

**Smart Features:**
- Auto-detect significance (many highlights = important checkpoint)
- Bundle rapid checkpoints (5 in 10 minutes = 1 consolidated)
- Context inheritance (new checkpoint inherits from previous)
- Session continuity tracking
- Automatic linking to active plans and todos

### 2. **`todo`** Tool - Current State (What Needs Doing)
Consolidates: `create_todo_list`, `update_todo`, `view_todos`

```typescript
interface TodoArgs {
  action: "create" | "update" | "view" | "complete" | "quick";
  
  // For create action
  title?: string;
  items?: string[];
  fromPlan?: string;  // Link to source plan
  
  // For update action
  listId?: string;  // Supports "latest", "active", partial matches
  itemId?: string;
  status?: "pending" | "active" | "done";
  newTask?: string;
  
  // For view action
  scope?: "current" | "all";
  summary?: boolean;
  
  // For quick action (replaces /todo command)
  quick?: string;  // "add buy milk" | "done 3" | "list"
}
```

**Smart Resolution:**
- "latest" → most recently updated list
- "active" → list with pending tasks
- Partial ID matching
- Auto-complete lists when all tasks done
- Progressive archival (active → archived → deleted)

### 3. **`plan`** Tool - Future Intent (How We'll Do It)
New tool for strategic planning and design decisions

```typescript
interface PlanArgs {
  action: "save" | "restore" | "update" | "complete" | "abandon" | "list";
  
  // For save action
  title?: string;
  description?: string;  // Full markdown plan
  items?: string[];      // High-level plan items
  category?: "feature" | "refactor" | "research" | "architecture";
  
  // For update action
  planId?: string;
  status?: "draft" | "active" | "complete" | "abandoned";
  outcomes?: string[];   // What actually happened
  lessons?: string[];    // What we learned
  
  // For complete/abandon
  reason?: string;
  nextSteps?: string[];
}

interface Plan extends GoldfishMemory {
  generatedTodos: string[];  // TODO lists created from this plan
  checkpoints: string[];     // Related checkpoint IDs
  completionPercentage: number;
  estimatedEffort?: string;
  actualEffort?: string;
}
```

**Smart Features:**
- Generate TODO lists from plan items
- Track plan execution progress
- Link checkpoints to active plan
- Capture lessons learned
- Plan templates for common patterns

### 4. **`standup`** Tool - Aggregated Intelligence
Promoted from command to first-class tool

```typescript
interface StandupArgs {
  since?: "24h" | "yesterday" | "this week" | "last sprint";
  include?: ("checkpoints" | "todos" | "plans")[];
  format?: "meeting" | "written" | "metrics" | "executive";
  workspace?: "current" | "all";
}
```

**Smart Aggregation:**
- **Yesterday:** Pull from checkpoints, completed todos, plan progress
- **Today:** Active todos, current plan items, scheduled work
- **Blockers:** Stalled todos (no progress >24h), abandoned plans, failing tests from checkpoints
- **Metrics:** Velocity (todos/day), plan success rate, checkpoint frequency

**Relationship Intelligence:**
```
Plan "Implement Auth" (60% complete)
  └→ TODO List "Auth Backend" (3/5 done)
      └→ Checkpoint "Completed JWT implementation"
  └→ TODO List "Auth Frontend" (2/4 done)  
      └→ Checkpoint "Added login form"
```

## Tool Consolidation Implementation

### Phase 1: TODO Consolidation (Immediate)
1. Create unified `todo` tool that routes to existing functions
2. Deprecate individual todo tools but keep functions
3. Update tool descriptions for AI agents
4. Maintain backward compatibility

```typescript
// New unified tool
export async function todo(storage: Storage, args: TodoArgs) {
  // Validate action
  if (!args.action) {
    args.action = inferAction(args); // Smart inference
  }
  
  switch(args.action) {
    case "create":
      return handleCreateTodoList(storage, args);
    case "update":
      return handleUpdateTodo(storage, args);
    case "view":
      return handleViewTodos(storage, args);
    case "complete":
      return handleCompleteTodoList(storage, args);
    case "quick":
      return handleQuickTodo(storage, args);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown action: ${args.action}`);
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Checkpoint Enhancement (Short-term)
1. Add `action` parameter to checkpoint tool
2. Merge restore_session logic into checkpoint
3. Add timeline view mode
4. Implement search within checkpoint tool

### Phase 3: Plan Tool Creation (Medium-term)
1. Create new plan tool with full lifecycle
2. Add plan → TODO generation
3. Link plans to checkpoints
4. Implement progress tracking

### Phase 4: Standup Tool Promotion (Medium-term)
1. Convert from command to MCP tool
2. Add relationship mapping
3. Implement smart aggregation
4. Add multiple format outputs

## Data Management Strategy

### Storage Structure Evolution
```
~/.coa/goldfish/{workspace}/
├── checkpoints/
│   ├── 2024-01-15/       # Daily organization
│   └── archive/          # Monthly compressed archives
├── todos/
│   ├── active/          # Current lists
│   └── archived/        # Completed/abandoned
├── plans/
│   ├── active/          # In-progress plans
│   ├── completed/       # Finished plans
│   └── templates/       # Reusable plan templates
└── index.json           # Relationship mappings & metadata
```

### Lifecycle Management
- **Checkpoints:** 30-day active, then compress monthly
- **TODOs:** 7-day active, 30-day archive, then delete
- **Plans:** Permanent (valuable for learning)

### Smart Cleanup
- Background cleanup during view operations
- Significance-based retention (keep important, prune routine)
- Workspace quotas (150 files default, configurable)

## Migration Path

### Backward Compatibility
- Old tool names redirect to new consolidated tools
- Existing data structures unchanged
- Gradual migration of features

### Configuration
```typescript
// Environment variables
GOLDFISH_CHECKPOINT_TTL_DAYS=30
GOLDFISH_MAX_FILES_PER_WORKSPACE=150
GOLDFISH_ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS=30
GOLDFISH_ENABLE_PLANS=true
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary (Proactive Use)
- Checkpoint saves per session
- TODO updates without prompting
- Plan creation for complex tasks
- Standup usage frequency

### Secondary (Effectiveness)
- Reduced file count over time
- Plan completion rate
- TODO velocity trends
- Session restoration success rate

## Future Considerations

### API Hub Integration
When ready for central API:
- Plans become shared team resources
- Standup aggregates across team members
- Checkpoint sync for backup
- Conflict resolution for shared todos

### Storage Backend Abstraction
```typescript
interface StorageBackend {
  // Minimal interface for swappability
  save(memory: GoldfishMemory): Promise<void>;
  load(id: string): Promise<GoldfishMemory>;
  search(criteria: SearchOptions): Promise<GoldfishMemory[]>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Options:
- FileSystemBackend (current, keep for checkpoints)
- SQLiteBackend (future, better for todos)
- APIBackend (team sync)
- HybridBackend (local + sync)

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why 4 Tools?
- **Cognitive limit:** 4-5 is optimal for decision making
- **Clear purposes:** Each tool has ONE primary job
- **Complete lifecycle:** Plan → Do → Track → Report
- **Natural workflow:** Maps to how developers actually work

### Why Keep File-Based Storage?
- **Simplicity:** No database dependencies
- **Portability:** Easy to backup/move
- **Debugging:** Can inspect/edit directly
- **Event sourcing:** Natural append-only model

### Why Consolidate vs Extend?
- **AI effectiveness:** Fewer tools = better decisions
- **User experience:** Less commands to remember
- **Maintenance:** Fewer code paths
- **Testing:** Clearer boundaries

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1: TODO Consolidation
- Implement unified todo tool
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update documentation

### Week 2: Plan Tool
- Create plan tool
- Add plan → TODO generation
- Test plan lifecycle

### Week 3: Checkpoint Enhancement  
- Add action routing
- Merge restore functionality
- Implement timeline view

### Week 4: Standup & Polish
- Promote standup to tool
- Add relationship tracking
- Performance optimization

## Notes from Discussion

### Critical Insights
1. **Proactive use is the win metric** - Tools that AI uses without prompting are the valuable ones
2. **Standup is a killer feature** - Daily usage makes it essential
3. **Search is overrated** - Restore and browse are more common than search
4. **Plans bridge strategy and tactics** - Missing piece between "what we want" and "what we do"

### User Workflow Reality
- Morning: standup for meeting
- Start: restore_session
- Work: checkpoints and todo updates
- Planning: Need to save decisions/designs

### What Not to Build
- Complex search interfaces
- Many similar tools
- Separate commands for every operation
- Over-engineered storage backends (yet)

## Conclusion

This evolution maintains Goldfish's simplicity while making it significantly more powerful. By consolidating to 4 smart tools, we reduce cognitive load while actually increasing functionality. The addition of plans completes the work management cycle, and promoting standup to a first-class tool acknowledges its daily value.

The phased implementation allows for gradual evolution without disrupting current usage. Most importantly, this design optimizes for the key success metric: proactive tool use by AI agents.
