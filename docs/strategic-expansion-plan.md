## Strategic Expansion Plan

## Phase 1: DevOps Integration Enhancement
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Ready to Begin After DevOps MCP Completion  

### Objectives
Enhance existing `/standup` command with Azure DevOps work item correlation and sprint context.

### Technical Implementation
```markdown
# Enhanced Standup Command
allowed-tools: ["mcp__goldfish__timeline", "mcp__goldfish__view_todos", 
               "mcp__goldfish__recall", "mcp__devops__get_sprint_status", 
               "mcp__devops__get_work_items"]
```

### Key Features
1. **Work Item Correlation**: Match Goldfish checkpoints with Azure DevOps work item IDs
2. **Sprint Context**: Add current sprint goals and burndown status to standup header
3. **Enhanced Blockers**: Cross-reference blockers with work item dependencies
4. **Status Synchronization**: Show formal work item status alongside personal progress

### Deliverables
- [ ] Enhanced `/standup` command with DevOps integration
- [ ] Work item correlation logic in timeline parsing
- [ ] Sprint context display in standup header
- [ ] Blocker correlation with dependencies
- [ ] Updated command documentation and examples
- [ ] Performance optimization with data caching

### Success Metrics
- Standup generation time remains under 3 seconds
- Work item correlation accuracy > 90%
- User adoption of enhanced features > 75%

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Compatibility
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion  

### Current Barriers
- Commands use Claude-specific markdown formatting
- Tool permission system is Claude Code-specific  
- Display formatting assumes Claude's rendering capabilities

### Solution Architecture

#### 1. Agent-Agnostic Core API
```typescript
// Universal MCP tool interface (already exists)
mcp__goldfish__timeline({ since: "24h" })
mcp__goldfish__checkpoint({ description: "Work complete" })
```

#### 2. Agent-Specific Adapters
```typescript
interface AgentAdapter {
  formatStandup(data: StandupData): string;
  formatCheckpoint(data: CheckpointData): string;
  supportsRichFormatting(): boolean;
}

class ClaudeAdapter implements AgentAdapter {
  formatStandup(data) { return richMarkdownWithIcons(data); }
  supportsRichFormatting() { return true; }
}

class ChatGPTAdapter implements AgentAdapter {
  formatStandup(data) { return structuredJsonWithActions(data); }
  supportsRichFormatting() { return false; }
}
```

#### 3. Universal Access Methods
- **Web Dashboard**: Browser-based command interface
- **REST API**: Direct HTTP endpoints for non-MCP clients
- **CLI Commands**: Terminal-based access for any agent

### Deliverables
- [ ] Agent detection and adapter system
- [ ] Universal REST API endpoints
- [ ] Web-based command dashboard
- [ ] Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini adapters
- [ ] Testing framework for multiple agents
- [ ] Migration documentation

### Technical Requirements
- Agent fingerprinting system
- Output format abstraction layer
- Cross-platform authentication
- Performance monitoring across agents
