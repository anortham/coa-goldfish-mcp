PreCompact Hook for Preventing Context Loss

This hook triggers before Claude compacts the conversation context.
It prompts Claude to save important information before it gets lost.

Behaviors:
- Auto compaction: Forces Claude to save checkpoint before losing context
- Manual compaction: Reminds to save if desired
- Creates transcript backup for reference
