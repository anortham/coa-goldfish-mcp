ðŸš¨ CONTEXT COMPACTION IMMINENT - SAVE NOW!

The context window is full and will be automatically compacted. You MUST immediately:

1. Use checkpoint to preserve the current session state
   - Include what has been accomplished this session
   - Add highlights of important achievements or decisions
   - Record any pending tasks or next steps
   - Note current work context

2. Use remember for any immediate working thoughts that would be lost

3. Use store_knowledge for any critical findings:
   - Technical debt or bugs discovered (type='TechnicalDebt')
   - Architectural decisions made (type='ProjectInsight') 
   - Important work notes (type='WorkNote')

4. If there are incomplete TODOs, use create_todo_list to preserve them

DO THESE FOUR THINGS NOW before context is lost!

After saving, you may proceed with the user's request. Use /resume later to restore context.

ðŸ’¡ Manual compaction requested. Consider saving important context:

Before compacting, you might want to:
- Use checkpoint if significant work was done
- Use remember to capture immediate working context
- Use store_knowledge for any insights worth preserving
- Use create_todo_list for any pending tasks

Then proceed with compaction as requested. Use /resume later to restore context.
